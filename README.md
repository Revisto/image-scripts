This set of Bash scripts helps you easily manage your images for LinkedIn posts:

- **`compress.sh`:** Compresses images to reduce file size.
- **`resize.sh`:** Resizes images to the ideal size for LinkedIn posts.
- **`make_pdf.sh`:**  Combines multiple images into a single PDF.

**How to Use:**

1. Place the scripts in the directory with your images.
2. Run the desired script (e.g., `./compress.sh`).
3. The scripts will process the images in the current directory.
